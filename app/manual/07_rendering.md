Introduction {#render_intro}
=======================

The NAP renderer is designed to be open and flexible. All render related functionality is exposed as a set of building blocks instead of a fixed function pipeline. You can use these blocks to set up your own rendering pipeline. Meshes, textures, materials, shaders, rendertargets, cameras and windows form the basis of these tools. They can be authored using JSON and are exported using your favourite content creation program (Photoshop, Maya etc.)

NAP uses <a href="https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/" target="_blank">Vulkan</a> to render objects but, contrary to popular game engines such as Unity or Unreal, doesn't lock down the rendering process. An object that can be rendered isn't rendered by default: you explicitly have to tell the renderer:

- That you want to render an object
- How you want to render an object
- Where to render it to, ie: it's destination

The destination is always a render target and NAP currently offers two: directly to a [window](@ref nap::RenderWindow) or an [off-screen target](@ref nap::RenderTarget). Often you want to render a set of objects to a texture before rendering the textures to screen. Or you might want to render only a sub-set of objects to screen one and another set of objects to screen two. This is one of NAPs biggest strengths and offers a lot of flexibility in deciding how you want to draw things.

Key Features {#key_features}
=======================
- Build your own render pipeline using easy to understand building blocks.

- Meshes are not limited to a specific set of vertex attributes such as 'color', 'uv' etc. Any attribute, such as ‘wind’ or ‘heat’, can be added to drive procedural effects. 

- NAP supports both static and dynamic meshes. It's easy to bind your own attributes to materials using a safe and easy to understand binding system.

- Rendering the same content to multiple windows is supported natively.

- All render functionality is fully compatible with the real-time editing system. Textures, meshes or shaders can be modified and reloaded instantly without having to restart the application.

Configuration {#render_config}
=======================
All global render settings are configurable using using the [nap::RenderServiceConfiguration](@ref nap::RenderServiceConfiguration). The render engine creates a Vulkan 1.0 instance by default, but applications may use Vulkan 1.1 and 1.2 functionality if required. Make sure to set the required major and minor vulkan version accordingly. The application will not start if the device does not support the selected (and therefore required) version of Vulkan. 

Example {#render_example}
=======================

This section explains the function and relationship of the various resources that were used in the `rotatingcube` [example](@ref getting_started_overview). That example renders a rotating cube with a texture to a window:

![](@ref content/gs_result.gif)

The following render related resources are used:

- [Image](@ref nap::ImageFromFile)
- [Shader](@ref nap::ShaderFromFile)
- [Material](@ref nap::Material)
- [Window](@ref nap::RenderWindow)
- [Mesh](@ref nap::BoxMesh)
- [Render Component](@ref nap::RenderableMeshComponent)
- [Transform Component](@ref nap::TransformComponent)

The actual application contains almost no code. Almost all the functionality comes from the resources and components defined in [Napkin](@ref napkin):

The `Image` points to a file on disk, which we want to apply as a texture to the cube. NAP loads the image from disk and uploads the pixel data to the GPU on initialization. The image is now a texture on the GPU that can be bound to the shader. The role of the material is to [bind](@ref bind_cube_texture) this `CubeTexture` to the `inTexture` input of the cube shader, just before the cube is rendered. Initialization fails if the material can't bind the texture to the shader because the input is missing.

Next we create a simple scene structure that contains the cube and a camera. The [renderable mesh component](@ref nap::RenderableMeshComponent) of the `CubeEntity` binds the mesh to the material and draws it when called by the render service, using the view matrix provided by the `CameraEntity`. Initialization of the component fails if the mesh / material combination is incompatible. The [transform component](@ref nap::TransformComponent) positions the cube at the origin of the scene and the [rotate component](@ref nap::RotateComponent) rotates the cube around the y axis once every 10 seconds.

On initialization of the app we fetch the resources required to render the cube:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
bool ExampleApp::init(utility::ErrorState& error)
{
	// Retrieve services
	mRenderService = getCore().getService<nap::RenderService>();
	mSceneService = getCore().getService<nap::SceneService>();

	// Fetch the resource manager
	mResourceManager = getCore().getResourceManager();

	// Find the render window
	mRenderWindow = mResourceManager->findObject<nap::RenderWindow>("Window");

	// Find the scene that contains our entities and components
	mScene = mResourceManager->findObject<Scene>("Scene");

	// Find the camera entity
	mCameraEntity = mScene->findEntity("CameraEntity");

	// Find the cube entity
	mCubeEntity = mScene->findEntity("CubeEntity");

	// All done!
	return true;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the render call of the app we tell the renderer to draw the cube using the camera:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Called when the window is going to render
void rotatingcubeApp::render()
{
	// Signal the beginning of a new frame, allowing it to be recorded.
	mRenderService->beginFrame();

	// Begin recording the render commands for the main render window
	if (mRenderService->beginRecording(*mRenderWindow))
	{
		// Begin render pass
		mRenderWindow->beginRendering();

		// Get Perspective camera to render with
		auto& perp_cam = mCameraEntity->getComponent<PerspCameraComponentInstance>();

		// Add Cube
		std::vector<nap::RenderableComponentInstance*> components_to_render
		{
			&mCubeEntity->getComponent<nap::RenderableComponentInstance>()
		};

		// Render Gnomon
		mRenderService->renderObjects(*mRenderWindow, perp_cam, components_to_render);

		// Stop render pass
		mRenderWindow->endRendering();

		// End recording
		mRenderService->endRecording();
	}

	// Proceed to next frame
	mRenderService->endFrame();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example covers the basics of rendering with NAP, but as you might have suspected: modern day rendering is a vast and complex subject. NAP's philosophy is to be open; it doesn't render for you. What NAP does best is getting you set up with the building blocks to render complex scenes. This also applies to many other facets of the framework. But in return you get a very open engine that allows you to render most things without having to write thousands of lines of code. 

To get a better understanding of rendering with NAP continue reading or play around with some of the demos that ship with NAP.

Meshes {#meshes}
=======================

Creating Meshes {#creating_meshes}
-----------------------

The underlying resource of all mesh types is the [IMesh](@ref nap::IMesh). The `IMesh` does only one thing: provide the renderer with a [mesh instance](@ref nap::MeshInstance). The mesh instance contains the actual data that is drawn. The following resources create a mesh instance:

###Mesh From File {#mesh_from_file}

The [MeshFromFile](@ref nap::MeshFromFile) loads a mesh from an external file. Mesh from file only supports the FBX file format and automatically converts any .fbx file in to a .mesh file using the FBX converter tool. The result is a heavily compressed binary file. The FBX converter runs automatically after compilation and only converts .fbx files when new. Alternatively you can run the tool from the command line. Type --help for instructions. If an .fbx file contains multiple meshes each mesh is stored into an individual .mesh file.

###Geometry From File  {#geometry_from_file}

The [GeometryFromFile](@ref nap::GeometryFromFile) imports 3D Geometry from an external file and converts the individual meshes into a single [mesh instance](@ref mesh_format). Every imported mesh becomes a shape, vertex attributes are shared. Many 3D geometry file formats are supported, including '.obj', '.fbx' etc.

###Predefined Shapes {#predefined_shapes}

Simple geometric shapes, inluding a [plane](@ref nap::PlaneMesh), [sphere](@ref nap::SphereMesh), [box](@ref nap::BoxMesh) and [torus](@ref nap::TorusMesh).

###Custom Mesh C++ {#custom_mesh}

You can define your own static or dynamic mesh in code. The `heightmap`, `videomodulation` and `dynamicgeo` demos show you how to approach this. In the following example we define a new dynamic mesh. On initialization the instance is created. For the mesh to behave and render correctly we add a set of attributes. In this case `position`, `uv`, `id` and `color`. The mesh contains no actual (initial) vertex data. The vertex data grows / shrinks over time based on the number of active particles in the scene. For a more complete example refer to the `dynamicgeo` demo.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
class ParticleMesh : public IMesh
{
public:

	/**
	 * Construct the mesh using the render service
	 */
	ParticleMesh(Core& core) : mRenderService(core.getService<RenderService>()) { }


	/**
	 * Create and initialize the mesh
	 */
	bool init(utility::ErrorState& errorState)
	{
		// Create the mesh instance
		mMeshInstance = std::make_unique<MeshInstance>(*mRenderService);

		// Because the mesh is populated dynamically we set the initial amount of vertices to be 0
		mMeshInstance->setNumVertices(0);
		mMeshInstance->setUsage(EMeshDataUsage::DynamicWrite);
		mMeshInstance->setDrawMode(EDrawMode::Triangles);
		mMeshInstance->setCullMode(ECullMode::None);

		// Allocate room for 1000 vertices
		mMeshInstance->reserveVertices(1000);

		// Add mesh attributes
		mMeshInstance->getOrCreateAttribute<glm::vec3>(vertexid::Position);
		mMeshInstance->getOrCreateAttribute<glm::vec3>(vertexid::getUVName(0));
		mMeshInstance->getOrCreateAttribute<glm::vec4>(vertexid::getColorName(0));
		mMeshInstance->getOrCreateAttribute<float>("pid");
			
		// Create the shape that connects the vertices
		MeshShape& shape = mMeshInstance->createShape();

		// Reserve CPU memory for the particle geometry indices.
		shape.reserveIndices(1000);

		// Initialize the instance
		return mMeshInstance->init(errorState);
	}

	/**
	 * @return MeshInstance as created during init().
	 */
	virtual MeshInstance& getMeshInstance()	override 					{ return *mMeshInstance; }

	/**
	 * @return MeshInstance as created during init().
	 */
	virtual const MeshInstance& getMeshInstance() const	override 		{ return *mMeshInstance; }

private:
	std::unique_ptr<MeshInstance> mMeshInstance = nullptr;
};
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Mesh Format {#mesh_format}
-----------------------

The mesh instance format is best explained by an example. Consider a mesh that represents the letter ‘P’:

![](@ref content/mesh_shapes.png)

This letter contains a list of 24 points. However, the mesh is split up into two separate pieces: the closed line that forms the outer shape and the closed line that forms the inner shape. The points of both shapes are represented by the blue and orange colors. 

Every mesh instance contains a list of points (vertices). Each vertex can have multipe attributes such as a normal, a UV coordinate and a color. In this example the mesh holds a list of exactly 24 vertices. To add each individual line to the mesh we create a [shape](@ref nap::MeshShape). The shape tells the system two things:

- How the vertices are connected using a list of indices. In this case vertices 0-12 define the outer shape, vertices 13-23 define the inner shape.
- How the GPU interprets the indices, ie: how are the points connected? For this example we tell the GPU to connect the vertices as a single line using `LineStrip`

Within a single mesh you can define multiple shapes that share the same set of vertices (points). It is allowed to share vertices between shapes and it is allowed to define a single mesh with different types of shapes. Take a sphere for example. The vertices can be used to define both the sphere as a triangle mesh and the normals of that sphere as a set of individual lines. The normals are rendered as lines (instead of triangles) but share (part of) the underlying vertex structure. This sphere therefore contains two shapes, one triangle shape (to draw the sphere) and one line shape (to draw the normals).

All common shapes are supported: `Points`, `Lines`, `LineStrip`, `Triangles`, `TriangleStrip` and `TriangleFan`.

As a user you can work on individual vertices or on the vertices associated with a specific shape. Often its necessary to walk over all the shapes that constitute a mesh. On a higher level NAP provides utility functions (such as computeNormals and reverseWindingOrder) to operate on a mesh as a whole. But for custom work NAP provides a very convenient and efficient [iterator](@ref nap::TriangleIterator) that is capable of looping over all the triangles within multiple shapes. This ensures that as a user you don’t need to know about the internal connectivity of the various shapes. Consider this example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// fetch uv attribute
Vec3VertexAttribute* uv_nattr = mesh.findAttribute<glm::vec3>(vertexid::getUVName(0));

// fetch uv center attribute 
Vec3VertexAttribute* uv_cattr = mesh.findAttribute<glm::vec3>("uvcenter");

// Create triangle iterator
TriangleShapeIterator shape_iterator(*mMeshInstance);

// Iterate over all the triangles and calculate average uv value for every triangle
TriangleIterator tri_iterator(*mMeshInstance);
while (!tri_iterator.isDone())
{
	// Get triangle
	Triangle triangle = tri_iterator.next();

	// Get uv values associated with triangle
	TriangleData<glm::vec3> uvTriangleData = triangle.getVertexData(*uv_nattr);

	// Calculate uv average
	glm::vec3 uv_avg = { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 };
	uv_avg += uvTriangleData.first();
	uv_avg += uvTriangleData.second();
	uv_avg += uvTriangleData.third();
	uv_avg /= 3.0f;
	
	// Set average to all vertices associated with triangle
	triangle.setVertexData(*uv_cattr, uv_avg);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mesh Usage {#mesh_usage}
-----------------------

The [mesh data usage flag](@ref nap::EMeshDataUsage) determines how the mesh data is used at runtime. A `Static` mesh is uploaded from the CPU to the GPU exactly once. This allows the system to remove unused buffers after the upload is complete. If there is the need to update a mesh more frequently, even once after upload, it is required the usage is set to `DynamicWrite`. Note that static meshes are often placed in a different cache on the GPU, not accessible by the CPU, which allows for faster drawing times. `DynamicWrite` meshes are uploaded into shared CPU / GPU memory and are therefore slower to draw. Keep this in mind when selecting the appropriate data use.

Text {#text}
=======================

Rendering text is similar to rendering meshes, but instead of a mesh every [component](@ref nap::Renderable2DTextComponent) that can draw text links to a [font](@ref nap::Font). You can change text at runtime by calling setText() or declare a line of text in json.

The [font resource](@ref nap::Font) loads a font file from disk. All well known font formats are supported, including ttf en otf. Fonts can scale up to any size and are always rendered in their native resolution when using the [Renderable2DTextComponent](@ref nap::Renderable2DTextComponent). This ensures a perfect text representation at every size.

There are currently two components that can draw text to screen: [Renderable2DTextComponent](@ref nap::Renderable2DTextComponent) and [Renderable3DTextComponent](@ref nap::Renderable3DTextComponent). When rendering text in screen space use the 2D version, when placing text somewhere in the world use the 3D version.

The [Renderable2DTextComponent](@ref nap::Renderable2DTextComponent) has a draw call that can be used to draw text directly at a specific location. The provided coordinates are in screen space (pixels), where 0,0 is the bottom left corner of your screen or back-buffer. Alternatively you can use the [render service](@ref nap::RenderService) to render your 2D text. This is similar to rendering meshes. 3D text is always rendered using the render-service. The component that renders text uses it's own hard coded [shader](@ref nap::FontShader) so you don't have to link in a custom material.

The `HelloWorld` demo shows you how to set this up.

Materials and Shaders {#materials}
=======================

A [shader](@ref nap::Shader) is a piece of code that is executed on the GPU. You can use shaders to perform many tasks including rendering a mesh to screen or in to a different buffer. The material tells the shader how to execute that piece of code. A material therefore:

- Defines the mapping between the mesh vertex attributes and the shader vertex attributes
- Stores and updates the uniform shader inputs
- Stores and updates the sampler shader inputs
- Controls render settings such as the blend and depth mode

Multiple materials can reference the same shader. You can change the properties of a material on a global (resource) and instance level. To change the properties of a material on an instance you use a [MaterialInstance](@ref nap::MaterialInstance) object. A material instance is used to override uniform and sampler inputs and change the render state of a material. This makes it possible to create a complex material with default attribute mappings and uniform inputs but override specific settings for a specific object. 

Imagine you have twenty buttons on your screen that all look the same, but when you move your mouse over a button you want it to light up. You can do this by making a single material that is configured to show a normal button and change the unifom `color` for the button you are hovering over. Changing the color uniform is done by altering the `color` attribute on the material instance.

Vertex Attributes {#vertex_attrs}
-----------------------
Meshes can contain any number of vertex attributes. How those attributes correspond to vertex attributes in the shader is defined in the material. It is simply a mapping from a mesh attribute ID (`Position`) to a shader attribute ID (`in_Position`). Consider this simple .vert shader:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
#version 450 core

uniform nap
{
	mat4 projectionMatrix;
	mat4 viewMatrix;
	mat4 modelMatrix;
} mvp;

in vec3	in_Position;			//< in vertex position object space
in vec4	in_Color0;				//< in vertex color
in vec3	in_UV0;					//< in vertex uv channel 0

out vec4 pass_Color;			//< pass color to fragment shader
out vec3 pass_Uvs;				//< pass uv to fragment shader

void main(void)
{
	// Calculate vertex position
    gl_Position = mvp.projectionMatrix * mvp.viewMatrix * mvp.modelMatrix * vec4(in_Position, 1.0);

	// Pass color and uv's 
	pass_Color = in_Color;
	pass_Uvs = in_UV;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This (vertex) shader doesn't do a lot. It transforms the vertex position and passes the vertex color and UV coordinates to the fragment shader. The vertex attributes are called `in_Position`, `in_Color0` and `in_UV0`. Next we bind the mesh vertex attributes to the shader vertex inputs using a material. To do that we provide the material with a table that binds the two together:

```
{
	"Type" : "nap::Material",
	"mID": "MyMaterial",
	"Shader": "MyShader",
	"VertexAttributeBindings" : 
	[
		{
			"MeshAttributeID": "Position",				//< Mesh position vertex attribute
			"ShaderAttributeID": "in_Position"			//< Shader position input
		},
		{
			"MeshAttributeID": "UV0",					//< Mesh uv vertex attribute
			"ShaderAttributeID": "in_UV0"				//< Shader uv input
		},
		{
			"MeshAttributeID": "Color0",				//< Mesh color vertex attribute
			"ShaderAttributeID": "in_Color0"			//< Shader color input
		}
	]		
}
```

The shader is always leading when it comes to mapping vertex attributes. This means that all the exposed shader vertex attributes need to be present in the material and on the mesh. It is also required that they are of the same internal type. To make things a bit more manageable and convenient: a mesh can contain more attributes than exposed by a shader. The mapping (as demonstrated above) can also contain more entries than exposed by a shader. This makes it easier to create common mappings and iterate on your shader. It would be inconvenient if the application yields an error when you comment out attributes in your shader. Even worse, if certain code in the shader is optimized out while working on it, certain inputs might not exist anymore. In these cases you don't want the initialization of your material to fail.

Default Vertex Attributes {#default_attrs}
-----------------------

Meshes that are loaded from file contain a fixed set of vertex attributes:
-	Position (required)
-	Normal (optional)
-	Tangent (auto generated when not available)
- 	Bitangents (auto generated when not available)
-	Multiple UV channels (optional)
-	Multiple Color channels (optional)

The names of the default vertex attributes can be retreived using a set of [global variables](@ref renderglobals.h).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
nap::vertexid::position
nap::vertexid::normal
nap::vertexid::color
nap::vertexid::uv
//etc...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every material creates a default mapping if no mapping is provided. The UV and Color attributes are included up to four channels. Default shader input names can be retrieved using a set of [global variables](@ref renderglobals.h), similar to vertex attributes:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
nap::vertexid::shader::position
nap::vertexid::shader::normal
nap::vertexid::shader::color
nap::vertexid::shader::uv
//etc...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table shows the default mesh to shader vertex bindings:

Mesh 			| Shader 			|
:-------------: | :-------------:	|
Position 		| in_Position		|
Normal 			| in_Normals		|
Tangent 		| in_Tangent 		|
Bitangent 		| in_Bitangent		|
UV0 			| in_UV0			|
UV1 			| in_UV1			|
UV2 			| in_UV2			|
UV3 			| in_UV3			|
Color0 			| in_Color0			|
Color1 			| in_Color1			|
Color2 			| in_Color2			|
Color2 			| in_Color2			|

Uniforms {#material_uniforms}
-----------------------

Uniforms are shader input 'values' that can be set in Napkin or at runtime using the material interface. Every material stores a value for each uniform in the shader. If there is no matching uniform, a default uniform will be created internally.

Consider the following *font.frag* shader example:

```
#version 450 core

in vec3 passUVs;
uniform sampler2D glyph;

uniform UBO
{
	uniform vec3 textColor;				//< Text color input
} ubo;

// output
out vec4 out_Color;

void main() 
{
	// Get alpha from glyph 
	float alpha = texture(glyph, passUVs.xy).r;

	// Use alpha together with text color as fragment output
	out_Color = vec4(ubo.textColor, alpha);
}
```

And corresponding JSON:

```
{
    "Type": "nap::Material",
    "mID": "FontMaterial",
    "Uniforms": [
        {
            "Type": "nap::UniformStruct",
            "mID": "nap::UniformStruct",
            "Name": "UBO",
            "Uniforms": [
                {
                    "Type": "nap::UniformVec3",
                    "mID": "UniformVec3",
                    "Name": "textColor",
                    "Value": {
                        "x": 1.0,
                        "y": 1.0,
                        "z": 1.0
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    ...
}
```

This material binds the color 'white' to the `textColor` uniform input of the shader. This means that all the text rendered with this material will be 'white' unless overridden. The `textColor` uniform value is part of the `UBO` uniform struct. Every uniform value must be a member of a uniform struct and can't be declared independent from a struct inside a shader. Uniform values can be directly overridden in JSON (using a [nap::MaterialInstanceResource](@ref nap::MaterialInstanceResource)) or overridden at run-time in code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
// Get 'UBO' struct that holds 'textColor'
nap::UniformStructInstance* ubo = text_comp.getMaterialInstance().getOrCreateUniform("UBO");

// Get text color, creates override if it doesn't exist
nap::UniformVec3Instance* text_color = ubo->getOrCreateUniform<UniformVec3Instance>("textColor");

// Override text color
text_color->setValue({1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f});
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The snippet above overrides the default text color from white to red at run-time. 

It is allowed to have more uniforms in the material than the shader. This is similar to vertex attributes with one major exception: not every uniform in the shader needs to be present in the material. Uniform value (and sampler) names must be unique accross all shader stages. This means that for this example the `UBO.textColor` uniform can't be declared in both the '.frag' and '.vert' part of the shader. Doing this will lead to unexpected results. Initialization of the material will fail when you try to bind a value to the wrong type of input.

Samplers {#material_samplers}
-----------------------

A sampler binds one or multiple textures to a shader input. They are declared independent of uniforms in the shader and don't have to be part of a uniform struct. Consider the following *.frag* example:

```
#version 450 core

// vertex shader input  
in vec4 passColor;						//< frag color

// unfiorm sampler inputs 
uniform sampler2D inTexture;			//< Input Texture

// output
out vec4 out_Color;

void main() 
{
	// Extract output color from texture
	vec3 out_color =  texture(inTexture, passUVs.xy).rgb * passColor.rgb;

	// Set fragment color
	out_Color =  vec4(out_color, 1.0);
}
```

And the following JSON:

```
{
	"Type": "nap::Material",
	"mID": "WorldMaterial",
	"Samplers": [
	    {
	        "Type": "nap::Sampler2D",
	        "mID": "world_input_tex_uniform",
	        "Name": "inWorldTexture"
	    }
	],
	...
}
```

This material binds the `WorldTexture` resource to the `inTexture` sampler of the shader. All objects rendered with this material will use this texture as input unless overridden. Samplers can be overridden using Napkin (using a [nap::MaterialInstanceResource](@ref nap::MaterialInstanceResource)) or overridden at run-time in code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
	// Get or create sampler override
	nap::MaterialInstance& material = render_comp.getMaterialInstance();
	Sampler2DInstance* sampler = material.getOrCreateSampler<Sampler2DInstance>("inTexture");

	// Update texture
	sampler->setTexture(newTexture);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Buffers {#material_buffers}
-----------------------
A buffer on a material binds a [GPUBuffer](@ref nap::GPUBuffer) to a shader input. Buffers are 'large' data containers that can be read *and written* to in a shader. The GPU buffer is a stand-alone resource that you declare in Napkin (similar to a 2D Texture) that can be written to and doesn't impose a layout. They are flexible, low level, data structures that you can use for all sorts of purposes in your render and compute pipeline.

There are various types of buffers, including simple [numeric buffers](@ref nap::GPUBufferNumeric), [vertex buffers](@ref nap::VertexBuffer), [index buffers](@ref nap::IndexBuffer) and [nested buffers](@ref nap::StructBuffer). The type of buffer, in combination with how it is configured, defines how it can be used in your application. You can, for example, use a [compute shader](@ref nap::ComputeShader) to update the contents of a vertex buffer, which is bound to the position attribute of your particle system when rendered. 

Consider the following *.comp* example from the `computeparticles` demo:

```
writeonly buffer VertexBuffer
{
    vec4 vertices[400000];
};

```
And the following JSON to bind a GPU buffer to it:
```
{
    "Type": "nap::VertexBufferVec4",
    "mID": "ParticleVertexBuffer",
    "Usage": "Static",
    "Count": 400000,
    "Clear": false,
    "FillPolicy": ""
},
{
    "Type": "nap::ComputeMaterial",
    "mID": "ComputeMaterial",
    "Buffers": [
        {
            "Type": "nap::BufferBindingVec4",
            "mID": "BufferBindingVec4_6c36afa1",
            "Name": "VertexBuffer",
            "Buffer": "ParticleVertexBuffer"
        }
    ],
    "Shader": "ComputeShader"
    ...
}
 ```

You can use a [fill policy](@ref nap::FillPolicy) to initialize the content of a GPU buffer. Without a fill policy the content isn't initialized. The `computeflocking` and `computeparticles` demos show you how to create, initialize and bind GPU buffers.

Constants {#material_constants}
-----------------------
Shader constants are special unsigned integer variables that are parsed on shader initialization, but not actually assigned and compiled until creation of a graphics pipeline. Shader constants implement Vulkan specialization constants and are a powerful way to compile specialized versions of shaders per material instance. Graphics and compute pipeline keys are distinguished by a shader constant hash that is generated from the material instance resource. This way you can benefit from compiler optimizations like loop unrolling and branch elimination per material setup.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.frag}
layout (constant_id = 0) const uint SAMPLE_COUNT = 8;
layout (constant_id = 1) const uint USE_EXPENSIVE_ROUTINE = 0;

// main()
// Loop unrolling
for (uint i = 0; i < SAMPLE_COUNT; i++)
{
		// Perform expensive texture samples here
}

// Branch elimination
if (USE_EXPENSIVE_ROUTINE > 0)
{
		// Perform an expensive computation here
}
else
{
		// Exit early here
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Color Blending {#blending}
-----------------------

Materials also control the [blend](@ref nap::EBlendMode) and [depth](@ref nap::EDepthMode) state of a material before rendering an object to a target. The blend state specifies how a color that is rendered using a shader is combined into the target buffer. Three modes are available:

- Opaque: The shader overwrites the target value
- AlphaBlend: The alpha value is used to blend between the current and target value
- Additive: The shader output is added to the target value

Depth {#depth}
-----------------------

The [depth](@ref nap::EDepthMode) state controls how the z-buffer is treated. These modes are available:

- ReadWrite: The z output value is tested against the z-buffer. If the test fails, the pixel is not written. If the test succeeds, the new z-value is written back into the z-buffer.
- ReadOnly: The z output value is tested against the z-buffer. If the test fails, the pixel is not written. The current z-value is never written back to the z-buffer.
- WriteOnly: The z buffer always overwrites the current z value with the new z value.
- NoReadWrite: The z buffer is never tested and therefore not updated. 
- InheritFromBlendMode: This is a special mode that determines how the z-buffer is treated based on the blend mode. For Opaque blend modes ReadWrite is used. For the other (transparent) modes ReadOnly is used. Transparent objects generally want to use the z-buffer but not use it.

You can specify the GPU state for material resources and material instances.

Rendering Meshes {#renderwithmaterials}
-----------------------

The [RenderableMeshComponent](@ref nap::RenderableMeshComponent) is responsible for rendering a mesh with a material.

To render an object you need to combine a mesh with a material instance. This combination is called a [RenderableMesh](@ref nap::RenderableMesh) and is created by the renderable mesh component. Every mesh / material combination is validated by the system. An error is generated when the mesh does not contain the attributes that are required by the shader. In most cases the renderable mesh is created by the system for you. This happens when you link to a mesh and material from a renderable mesh component. The renderable mesh is automatically created when the component is initialized. When initialization succeeds the component is able to render all the shapes in the mesh instance. The [example](@ref render_example) at the top of this page shows you how to set this up.

You can switch between materials and meshes by providing the renderable mesh component with a different renderable mesh. When you want to switch only the material you can create new renderable mesh by calling [createRenderableMesh()](@ref nap::RenderableMeshComponentInstance::createRenderableMesh) using the existing mesh and a different material. Using this construct you can change a material, mesh or both. The mesh / material combination will be validated when creating a new renderable mesh. It is strongly recommended to create all selectable mesh / material combinations on initialization. This ensures that you can safely swap them at run time. The video modulation demo shows you how to create and switch between a selection of meshes at run-time.

Textures {#textures}
=======================

There are a lot of similarities between meshes and [textures](@ref nap::Texture2D). Both can be loaded from file and created (or updated) using the CPU. There are however some operations that only apply to textures:

- Textures can be read back from the GPU into CPU memory. Synchronous and asynchronously.
- Textures don't require a CPU data representation. For example: the [render texture](@ref nap::RenderTexture2D) only exists on the GPU.
- Some textures are continuously updated. This occurs when working with video or image sequences.

Creating Textures {#creating_textures}
-----------------------

NAP offers a small set of classes to work with textures.

![](@ref content/nap_textures.png)

The base class for all textures in NAP is [Texture2D](@ref nap::Texture2D). This object only holds the GPU data. External CPU storage is required when:
- Pixel data needs to be uploaded to the GPU.
- Pixel data needs to be read from the GPU to a CPU buffer.

CPU storage is provided in the form of a [Bitmap](@ref nap::Bitmap). The bitmap offers a high level CPU interface to work with pixel data. It allows you to:
- Retrieve individual pixels from the underlying data buffer.
- Set individual pixels in the buffer.
- Perform pixel color conversion operations.
- Retrieve information such as the amount of color channels, ordering of the pixel data etc.

You can also use a more low-level interface to upload data directly into your texture. This interface works with pointers and can be used to stream in large quantities of external data.

###GPU Textures {#gpu_textures}###

The [RenderTexture](@ref nap::RenderTexture2D) creates a 2D texture on the GPU that *can* be attached to a [render target](@ref nap::RenderTarget). You use the render target to draw a set of objects to a texture instead of a window. The various properties of the texture and render target can be edited in Napkin. 

Set the `Usage` of the texture to `Static` when you want to use it in combination with a render target. This is important because we never read or write from or to the texture using the CPU. Only the GPU uses the texture as a target for the render operation.

###Images {#images}###

An [Image](@ref nap::Image) is a two-dimensional texture that manages the data associated with a texture on the CPU and GPU. The CPU data is stored internally as a [bitmap](@ref nap::Bitmap). This makes it easy to: 
- Quicky upload pixel data from the CPU to the GPU
- Transfer pixel data from the GPU to the CPU

It is easy to change the contents of an image at runtime:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
void App::update()
{	
	// Get the CPU image data as a bitmap
	Bitmap& bitmap = mImage.getBitmap();

	// Adjust the pixel data here....

	// Upload changes to the GPU
	mImage.update();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

###Image From File {#image_from_file}###

[ImageFromFile](@ref nap::ImageFromFile) allows you to load an image from disk. This object offers the exact same functionality as a native image. You can update your content or read data from the GPU using the same interface.

Reading Textures From The GPU {#reading_textures}
-----------------------

Textures contain the output of a GPU rendering step when they are assigned to a render target. You can read back the result from a texture on the GPU to the CPU using the 2D texture or image interface. The following functions allow you to transfer the rendered texture back from the GPU to the CPU:

- [nap::Texture2D::asyncGetData(Bitmap& bitmap)](@ref nap::Texture2D::asyncGetData)
- [nap::Image::asyncGetData()](@ref nap::Image::asyncGetData)

You can see that the 2D texture interface requires you to pass in external storage in the form of a bitmap. The image interface will transfer the image back into its internal bitmap. The asyncGetData() function will not stall the CPU because it queues the copy operation on the GPU. After the copy is executed by the GPU the data is automatically transferred. Note that you can only schedule a download during rendering, in between `beginFrame()` and `endFrame()`.

Texture Usage {#texture_usage}
-----------------------

The texture `Usage` flag allows you to specify how the texture is going to be used.

- `Static`: The texture does not change after initial upload.
- `DynamicRead`: Texture is frequently read from GPU to CPU.
- `DynamicWrite`: Texture is frequently updated from CPU to GPU.

It's important to choose the right setting based on your needs. It is for example not allowed to update `Static` or `DynamicRead` textures after the initial upload from the CPU because the staging buffer is deleted after upload. Doing so will result in render artifacts (depending on the driver) or potentially a system crash. On the other hand: `DynamicWrite` allocates additional resources on the GPU and should therefore only be used if you are going to write to the texture more than once from the CPU. Note that it is perfectly safe to set the usage to `Static` when frequently writing to it on the GPU only, for example when using it as a render target.

Texture Sampling {#texture_sampling}
-----------------------

A sampler [parameters](@ref nap::Sampler) controls how a texture is sampled. These are the parameters that can be specified:

- `MinFilter`: Controls how the texels are blended when the texture is minified.
- `MaxFilter`: Controls how the texels are blended when the texture is magnified.
- `MipMapMode`: Controls how texels are blended between mip-maps.
- `AddressModeVertical`: How the UV mapping is interpreted vertically.
- `AddressModeHorizontal`: How the UV mapping is interpreted horizontally.
- `AnisotropicSamples`: Max number of anisotropic filter samples.
- `MaxLodLevel`: Max number of lods to use.

A `MaxLodLevel` level of 0 disables mip-mapping and is ignored when mip mapping is turned off. This causes the renderer to only use the highest (native) texture resolution.

Windows {#multi_screen}
=======================

You can add as many windows to your application as you want. Take a look at the multi window demo for a working example. That demo spawns three windows and renders the same set of objects (in different configurations) to every one of them. In your application you have to activate the window you want to render to before issuing any draw commands. This is demonstrated in the example below:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
void MultiWindowApp::render()
{
	// Signal the beginning of a new frame, allowing it to be recorded.
	mRenderService->beginFrame();

	// Render to window one
	if(mRenderService->beginRecording(*mRenderWindowOne))
	{
		// Begin the render pass
		mRenderWindowOne->beginRendering();

		...

		// Draw gui to window one
		mGuiService->draw();

		// End rendering and recording
		mRenderWindowOne->endRendering();
		mRenderService->endRecording();
	}

	// Render to window two
	if(mRenderService->beginRecording(*mRenderWindowTwo))
	{
		// Begin render pass
		mRenderWindowTwo->beginRendering();

		...

		// Draw gui to window two
		mGuiService->draw();

		// End rendering and recording
		mRenderWindowTwo->endRendering();
		mRenderService->endRecording();
	}

	// End frame
	mRenderService->endFrame();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Offscreen Rendering {#offscreen_rendering}
=======================

Often you want to render a selection of objects to a texture instead of a screen. But you can't render to a texture directly, you need a [render target](@ref nap::RenderTarget) to do that for you. Every render target requires a link to a [render texture](@ref nap::RenderTexture2D). The result of the render step is stored in the texture. 

Declare and set up the render target in Napkin. Next, in your application, locate the target and render your selection of items to it. This must be done in between `beginHeadlessRecording` and `endHeadlessRecording`: 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}

void VideoModulationApp::render()
{
	// Signal the beginning of a new frame, allowing it to be recorded.
	mRenderService->beginFrame();

	// Start recording into the headless recording buffer.
	if (mRenderService->beginHeadlessRecording())
	{
		// Render into the render target
		mVideoRenderTarget->beginRendering();
		...
		mVideoRenderTarget->endRendering();

		// Tell the render service we are done rendering into render-targets.
		mRenderService->endHeadlessRecording(); 
	}

	// Done rendering this frame
	mRenderService->endFrame();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All headless (non window) render operations need to be executed within the headless recording block. Alternatively you can use the [RenderToTextureComponent](@ref nap::RenderToTextureComponent). This component allows you to render to a texture directly in screen space, without the need to define a render target or mesh, and can be used to apply a 'post process' render step. The video modulation demo uses this component to convert the output of a video player into a greyscale texture.

Cameras {#cameras}
=======================

NAP supports two camera types:

- [Orthographic](@ref nap::OrthoCameraComponent)
- [PerSpective](@ref nap::PerspCameraComponent)

With an orthographic camera the scene is rendered using a flat projection matrix. With an orthographic camera the scene is rendered using a perspective matrix. The world space location of a camera, provided using a [transform](@ref nap::TransformComponent), is used to compose the view matrix. The camera projection method is used to compose the projection matrix. Both are extracted by the renderer and forwarded to the shader. 

Every camera therefore needs access to a transform component that is a sibling of the parent entity. For a working example take a look at the multi window demo. This demo renders a set of objects to different windows using a mix of cameras.

Layers {#layers}
=======================

Render layers can be used to group render components and configure the order in which they should be rendered. `nap::RenderLayer` objects are ordered in a `nap::RenderLayerRegistry` under the property `Layers`. The index of the layer in this list determines the rank of the `nap::RenderLayer` where 0 is the front, and the last index is the back. Render components without a layer assigned default to the front (index 0).

One useful approach for layers is rendering a sky box or some other object that fills the background. This should always be rendered first, regardless of its location in the world. To do this, you can create a layer named "Background" last index in the registry and assign it to the component that renders the background. Other objects in the scene can be assigned to the layer "Default" on index 0 and will be sorted routinely based on the specified sorting algorithm.

Tags {#tags}
=======================

Render tags can be used to categorize render components. Unlike render layers, tags are unordered and multiple of them can be assigned to a single render component. Each tag resource registers itself in the render service and is assigned a unique tag index on app initialization. This ensures tags can be composited into render masks, which are bit flags that are fast to compare.

One useful example would be to categorize specific components as "Debug", distinguishing objects used as visual aid for debugging purposes from standard objects (tag "Default"). They may be excluded from rendering based on settings or a window setup for instance. You could do the following:

`````{.cpp}
// Consider caching the render mask
RenderMask mask = mRenderService->findRenderMask("Default") | mRenderService->findRenderMask("Debug");
mRenderService->renderObjects(renderTarget, camera, render_comps, mask);
`````
Advanced Rendering {#advanced_rendering}
=======================

NAP 0.7 introduces the new `naprenderadvanced` module comprising a set of rendering tools in supplement to the functionality of `naprender`. These currently include a system for setting up lights, rendering shadow and cube maps, various new standard shaders and several rendering-related utilities. The `nap::RenderAdvancedService` creates and manages internal resources such as render targets and textures that are bound to materials that use these advanced features.

Lights {#lights}
=======================

The `naprenderadvanced` module includes a light system that can be used to create consistent lighting setups across render components fast. Any instance of a light is derived from `nap::LightComponent`/`nap::LightComponentInstance`. On initialization, each light component sets up its own light uniform data and registers itself at the `nap::RenderAdvancedService`. Light components are deregistered and registered again when appropriate on hot-reloads. NAP currently offers the following light types:

- `nap::DirectionalLightComponent`
- `nap::PointLightComponent`
- `nap::SpotLightComponent`

To visualize a lit renderable component its material must be compatible with the light system. This is fairly simple to do in Napkin: Create a `nap::BlinnPhongShader` resource, and then a `nap::Material` whose `Shader` property links to this shader. It is also possible to write a custom `nap::ShaderFromFile` shader that is compatible with the lighting system. For a guide to set this up, please refer to the section [Custom Lights](@ref custom_lights) below.

Additional data related to the material surface is excluded from the system and must be set by the user. In the case of the `nap::BlinnPhongShader` these include `ambient`, `diffuse` and `specular` because they relate to material properties rather than light properties. The maximum number of lights per scene is always limited to `getMaximumLightCount`, superfluous lights are ignored. 

Rendering with lights requires an additional call to `pushLights` with the render components whose material instances you wish to update light uniforms of. Alternatively, `renderShadows` with the `updateMaterials` argument set to `true` updates light uniforms and renders a shadow map. Here is how to render shadow maps in the `render()` hook of your app:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
void LightsAndShadowApp::render()
{
	mRenderService->beginFrame();

	std::vector<RenderableComponentInstance*> render_comps;
	mWorldEntity->getComponentsOfTypeRecursive<RenderableComponentInstance>(render_comps);

	if (mRenderService->beginHeadlessRecording())
	{
		mRenderAdvancedService->renderShadows(render_comps, true, mShadowMask);
		mRenderService->endHeadlessRecording();
	}
	// ...
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you do not intend to re-render shadows each frame, you can also exclusively update the material data of the components that are lit. The code snippet below filters the list of render components for those that contain the tag `Lit`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}

utility::ErrorState error_state;
auto lit_comps = mRenderService->filterObjects(render_comps, mRenderService->findRenderMask("Lit"));
if (!mRenderAdvancedService->pushLights(lit_comps, error_state))
	nap::Logger::error(error_state.toString().c_str());
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a complete demonstration of the light system, check out the new `lightsandshadow` demo.

Custom Lights {#custom_lights}
=======================

In order for shaders to be compatible with the light system they must include a specific uniform struct with the name `light`, and additionally `shadow` when shadows are supported. In your shader files, first make sure to enable the `GL_GOOGLE_include_directive` extension to enable shader include files. Then, include the following files (`shadow.glslinc` is optional). Please note that NAP is only able to locate these module-specific shader files if your application is dependent on `naprenderadvanced`.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.vert}{.frag}
#extension GL_GOOGLE_include_directive : enable

#include "maxlights.glslinc"	// Include MAX_LIGHTS constant
#include "light.glslinc"		// Include Light struct, light types and helper functions
#include "shadow.glslinc"		// Include functions for computing shadows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will include the `Light` data structure in your shader as defined in `light.glslinc` and looks like this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.vert}{.frag}
struct Light
{
	vec3 origin;
	vec3 direction;
	vec3 color;
	float intensity;
	float attenuation;
	float angle;
	float falloff;
	uint flags;
};
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When implementing a custom shader that is compatible with the light system you can define the following uniform struct and read the data of `count` lights.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.vert}{.frag}
uniform light
{
	Light lights[MAX_LIGHTS];
	uint count;
} lit;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is a simple approach to mixing lights using the `computeLight` function in `blinnphongutils.glslinc`. `isLightEnabled` in `light.glslinc` checks whether the light is enabled by reading the appropriate bit flag.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.frag}
vec3 color = vec3(0.0;
for (uint i = 0; i < min(lit.count, MAX_LIGHTS); i++)
{
	if (!isLightEnabled(lit.lights[i].flags))
		continue;

	color += computeLight(lit.lights[i], mtl, mvp.cameraPosition, normalize(passNormal), passPosition);
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a complete example of how to write a compatible shader for NAP's light system, refer to the `blinnphongcolor` shader in the `naprenderadvanced/data/shaders` folder. This also shows how to setup quad and omni shadow mapping.

Cube Maps {#cube_maps}
=======================

`nap::CubeMapFromFile` takes an image with an equirectangular projection as input and generates a `nap::RenderTextureCube` from it. This can then be sampled to render a sky box (see `nap::SkyBoxShader`), or add environmental reflections to objects. The `nap::BlinnPhongShader` includes the sampler `environmentMap`, and uniform `reflection` for this purpose.  

This object must be pre-rendered at least once in a headless render pass in the first frame. The `nap::RenderAdvancedService` queues a `nap::HeadlessRenderCommand` for each `nap::CubeMapFromFile` in the scene after resource initialization, and will be handled when headless render commands are recorded. The code below only begins a headless recording operation only when headless commands are queued in the render service.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
if (mRenderService->isHeadlessCommandQueued())
{
	// Handles `nap::CubeMapFromFile` pre-render operations in the first frame
	if (mRenderService->beginHeadlessRecording())
		mRenderService->endHeadlessRecording();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
